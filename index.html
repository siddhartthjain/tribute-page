        <p><u>Doctors</u> </p>
        <img src="C:\Users\Siddharth's\Desktop\html\tribute page\image\doctor.jpg" alt="">
       <ul>

           <li>
            While on one hand people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses 
            and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers,
             and medical staff members are leading the battle against COVID-19 from the front.
           </li>
           <br>
           <li>Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of 
            healing patients and saving their lives but have
             also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed
              their own lives in the line of duty
            </li>
            <br>
           <li>Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, 
               they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families,
                and most importantly their own lives at risk, 
               the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors
            </li>

        <p><u>Policemens</u> </p>
       <div class="clearfix"></div>
       <img src="C:\Users\Siddharth's\Desktop\html\tribute page\image\police.jpg" alt="">
        <ul>
            <li>
                The police are a primary port of access to State services, and the lockdown brings officers into regular contact with citizens
                 needing urgent assistance.
                 Police officers are also at the forefront of India’s public health campaign, 
                 providing information and essential supplies. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>After the lockdown order, police agencies aggressively enforced social distancing through patrolling vans, 
                foot patrols, and vehicular checkpoints. These techniques follow a conventional “law and order” paradigm, 
                which is engrained into the training and organisational culture of the police.
             </li>
             <br>
            <li> As we respond to changes in the security landscape and societal norms,
         police face new challenges such as the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
         This has added an additional layer to risk to their everyday work as the close-contact nature 
         of their role brings them into contact with the virus. Once again, police officers worldwide are risking their 
         lives and paying the ultimate price to keep our families, homes and communities safe.

        <ul>
            <li>
                These paramedical workers perform routine diagnostic procedures, such as the taking of blood samples, and therapeutic procedures, 
                such as administering injections
                or suturing wounds; they also relieve physicians of making routine health assessments and taking medical histories. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The staff like ambulance drivers,cremation workers,support-staffs of various organisations are unsung hero in this fight.
                They daily fight this deadly virus to serve people. they re the first and also the last contact of this virus.
                the works of these heroes need to be appreciated 
             </li>

        <ul>
            <li>The list doesnt getover here there are lot of lot of more warriors fighting for us,with us.
                the applauds does not stop for blood services,pharmacist,laboratories ,care centers,fire staff and many more,
                to protect us from this deadly virus in any way 
                 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families 
                and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong
                 gratitude on our end.
                 Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us
             </li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The sacrifice of doctors and healthcare workers across the globe will not go to waste.
             Humanity will always be grateful to them for what they are doing during these unprecedented times.
             The respect for healthcare professionals has grown manifolds in the hearts of people.
        </li>
        <li>
            Even after an year and the painstaking attempt to stop the virus we are still not finished yet.
        Thus by staying at home ,wearing masks, washing hands,caring of immunity,and if applicable getting vaccinated 
        would be the best tribute to these warriors.
